# women-can-code-flah
*I'm a woman. I graduated in chemistry, practiced the profession, but I didn't identify myself. 
I am now majoring in Accounting Science, I love finance, and I am learning about programming languages. 
I've already been introduced to Python and now I'm participating in the Women Can Code program, I'm getting to know node.js.
So, come and see my learning...*
